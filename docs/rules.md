# Le Jeu de la Faim

## Core Game Rules

### Overview
You are a tribute in the Hunger Games, fighting for survival against other tributes in a dangerous arena. Only one tribute can emerge victorious.

### Game Structure
- The game starts with all tributes gathered around the Cornucopia
- Each day is divided into day and night phases
- Each phase has two parts: movement and action

### Vital Stats
Every tribute must manage:
- Health: Getting hurt reduces it, and death occurs at 0
- Hunger: Must eat regularly to survive
- Thirst: Must drink regularly to survive
- Energy: Depletes at night if not resting
- Mental health: Affected by lack of sleep and other factors
- Hype: Sponsor approval that can lead to receiving gifts

### Movement
- The arena is divided into different biomes (forest, lake, rain forest, etc.)
- You can move one space at a time (north, south, east, west) or stay put
- Each biome offers different advantages for resource gathering

### Actions
You can choose between:
- Hunt: Attack other tributes
- Gather: Search for food, water, and weapons
- Rest: Recover energy (especially important at night)
- Hide: Lower chance of being attacked, may still find resources

## Strategic Elements

### The Cornucopia
- Initial choice: Run towards weapons but risk death, or flee to safety
- The Cornucopia area has the highest chance of finding weapons

### Sponsor System
- Violent actions and kills increase sponsor approval ("hype")
- Hiding and passive actions decrease sponsor approval
- High approval can result in receiving vital supplies from sponsors

### Combat
- Better weapons deal more damage
- Attacking tributes who are gathering or resting gives you an advantage
- Night time reduces combat effectiveness

### Survival Tips
- Water and food are crucial for survival
- Rest is essential during night phases to avoid mental health deterioration
- Staying in the same location for too long will reveal your position
- Different biomes offer different resource advantages (e.g., lakes provide more water)

## Winning Condition
Be the last tribute standing, either through combat prowess or superior survival skills.
